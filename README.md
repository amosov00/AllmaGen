### Backend Features
- Simulating database queries
- The application does not contain an internal state, so scaling is possible using Kubernetis
- Available rest API for receiving data
- User input validation and error handling
- Developed an effective algorithm for calculating "EvPM" and "CTR" depending on the entered time period

### Frontend Features
- Сompetent use of ready-made UAI library
- Processing and logging errors of interaction with the backend
- Implemented drawing of graphs
- Ability to enter and load different time values for CTR и EvPM
- Ability to select a tag in the selector for the EvPM chart
- Implemented a label with which you can see the exact date and immediately hover over the griffac
- Implemented routing between different sections of the application
- For both tables and charts I made a beautiful blur and an amazing loader that appear while loading data
- Blocking buttons (user input) during loading
- Made a table that displays all actions performed by the user
- combined tags with "v" and without "v" into a single whole
- Made it possible to filter the table by all possible parameters
- Implemented the ability to calculate parameters "Impressions", "CTR" and "EvPM" based on selected rows in the table (based on the selected parameter in the top right of the table)
- Made links in the table clickable
